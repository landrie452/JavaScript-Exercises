    <p>Let's say in the Amozon project, we have a basketball product. This product has a name of 'basketball', a price of 2095 cents. Create an object to represent this product and display it in the console.</p>

    <script>
        const basketball= {
            price:2095
        }
        console.log(basketball);
    </script>
